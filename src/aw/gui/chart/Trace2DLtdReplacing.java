/**
 *  In addition to the <code> Trace2DLtd</code> this class offers the guarantee 
 *  only to allow a single tracepoint with a certain x- value. If a new 
 *  tracepoint is added whose x- value is already contained, the new tracepoints 
 *  values will get assigned to the certain old tracepoint respecting the fact 
 *  that only an additional changed y- value occurs. 
 *  <br>
 *  The <code>add</code> methods increase complexity to factor n but some event - 
 *  handling may be saved (no change of x and y).
 * <br>
 *  Tracepoints with x- values not contained before will be appended to the end 
 *  of the internal data- structure. <br>
