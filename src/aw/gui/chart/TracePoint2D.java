/**
 *  A specialized version of <code>java.awt.Point2D.Double </code>who carries two further
 *  values: <code> double scaledX</code> and <code>double scaledY</code> which
 *  allow the <code>Chart2D</code> to cache the scaled values (between 0.0 and 1.0)
 *  without having to keep a copy of the aggregators (<code>ITrace2D</code>)
 *  complete tracepoints. This avoids the necessarity to care for the correct
 *  order of a set of scaled tracepoints copied for caching purposes. Especially
 *  in the case of new <code>TracePoint2D</code> instances added to a
 *  <code>ITrace2D</code> instance managed by a <code>Chart2D</code> there
 *  remains no responsibility for sorting the cached copy. This allows that the
 *  managing <code>Chart2D</code> may just rescale the newly added tracepoint
 *  instead of searching for the correct order of the new tracepoint by value -
 *  comparisons of x and y: The <code>TracePoint2D</code> passed to the method
 *  <code>traceChanged(Chart2DDataChangeEvent e)<code> coded in the argument is
 *  the original. <br>
 *  <p>
 *  Why caching of scaled values for the coordinates?<br>
 *  This takes more RAM but else for every <code>repaint()</code> invocation of
 *  the <code>Chart2D</code> would force all tracepoints of all traces to be
 *  rescaled again.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *   A TracePoint2D will inform it's listener of type <code>ITrace</code>
 *  on changes of the internal values.
