/**
 *  An interface used by <code>Chart2D</code>.
 *  ITrace2D contains the values to display, the color for displaying and
 *  a suitable lable. It may be seen as a trace of the <code>Chart2D</code>
 *  that displays it. <br>
 *  Implementations may be optimized for different use- cases: <br>
 *  RingBuffers for fast changing data to keep the amount of tracepoints and
 *  consumption of memory constant,
 *  internal Lists for allowing the sorting the internal <code>TracePoint2D</code>- instances
 *  or Arrays for unordered Data (in the order of adding) for fast performance.
 *  Even an <code>ITrace2D</code> constructed by a "function- Object" may be
 *  thinkable.
 *  <p>
 *  There are various constraints for Traces:<br>
 *  - ordered by x-values<br>
 *  - ordered by the order of <code>addPoint</code> - invocation (control form outside)<br>
 *  - unique, single x- values <br>
 *  - limitation of tracepoints <br>
 *  - time- critical (fast- changing tracepoints) <br>
 *   <br>
 *  Therefore there are various <code>ITrace2D</code> - implementations. Read
 *  their description to find the one you need. Some may not have been written yet.
 *  </p>
