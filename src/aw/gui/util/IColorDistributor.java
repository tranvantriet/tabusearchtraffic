/**
 * An interface for the following purpose:<br>
 * Implementations are keeping track of the java.awt.Color - instances they 
 * gave away during invocation of <code>getColor()</code>. The aim is to 
 * provide an interface that allows to get unique colors from. As all colors 
 * given away are remembered, it is possible to avoid lending the same color 
 * several times.<br>
 * It will be tricky to implement this in a good way because of the fact that the 
 * ColorLessor should not be limited to a maximum amount of colors, it does 
 * not know how much different colors there will be asked for a priori,  
 * the amount of colors given away should be the most visual different and the 
 * background color should be especially different from all ohter colors given away.
